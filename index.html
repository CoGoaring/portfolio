            <p id="about-me">My name is Connor Goaring, and I have had a long-time interest in programming/coding. In middle school I took my first
                half programming and half design class, where I learned how much fun programming small robots was. In high school I 
                then took 4 years of programming in the Skyview SMT Robotics program, as well as some extra coding classes and 
                extracurricular events. I was one of the lead programmers during the last 2 years as well, and found myself loving
                learning and solving new problems everyday through code. Below is a list of some of my projects, and my other socials 
                that you can find me on. I will keep it updated with my works in progress and my finished projects.
